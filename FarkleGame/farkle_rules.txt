====================================
          FARKLE GAME RULES
====================================

OBJECTIVE
---------
Be the first player to reach 10,000 points by rolling combinations of dice.

PLAYERS
-------
- Minimum: 2 players
- No upper limit on number of players

SCORING
-------
- Single 1 = 100 points
- Single 5 = 50 points
- Three of a kind = face value x 100
    -> Example: Three 2s = 200, Three 5s = 500
- Exception: Three 1s = 1,000 points

GAMEPLAY
--------
- Roll all 6 dice.
- Set aside any point dice (1s, 5s, or triples).
- You may re-roll the remaining dice to earn more points.
- A "Farkle" occurs when no point dice are rolled.
    -> You lose all points for that turn.
- If all 6 dice score, you must re-roll all 6 at least once more before stopping. 

ENTERING THE GAME
-----------------
- You must score 1,000 or more points in a single turn to begin recording points.
- Until you enter the game, your points do not count.

STRATEGY TIP
------------
- You do not have to keep every point die.
- Example: Roll a 1 and 5 - keep the 1 and re-roll the 5 to aim for a triple.
- At least one point die must be set aside after every roll.

WINNING THE GAME
----------------
- The first player to reach 10,000 points triggers the final round.
- All other players get one last turn to beat that score.
- The player with the highest score after the final round wins.
