====================================
         FARKLE GAME RULES
            Version 2.0
====================================

OBJECTIVE
---------
Be the first player to reach 10,000 points by rolling scoring combinations
and choosing wisely which dice to keep.

PLAYERS
-------
- Minimum: 2 players
- No upper limit on number of players

SCORING (STANDARD)
------------------
Single Dice:
- Single 1   = 100 points
- Single 5   = 50 points

Three of a Kind:
- Three 1s   = 1,000 points
- Three Xs   = X * 100 points
  (Example: Three 2s = 200, Three 5s = 500)

Extended Sets (Hybrid System):
- 4 of a kind = (base triple score) * 2
- 5 of a kind = (base triple score) * 3
- 6 of a kind = (base triple score) * 4

Special Combinations:
- Straight (1–6)     = 1500 points
- Three Pairs        = 1500 points

GAMEPLAY
--------
1. Roll all 6 dice.
2. Set aside any scoring dice you choose to keep.
   - You may keep ANY scoring dice (flexible selection).
3. You may re-roll the remaining dice to earn more points.
4. You must keep at least one scoring die on each roll.
5. A "Farkle" occurs when no scoring dice appear:
   - You lose all points earned during that turn.
6. If all 6 dice score ("hot dice"), you must roll all 6 dice again.

ENTERING THE GAME
-----------------
- You must score 500 or more points in a single turn to start recording
  points toward your total score.
- Until you enter the game, turn scores below 500 do not count.

WINNING THE GAME
----------------
- The first player to reach 10,000 points triggers the final round.
- All other players get one more chance to beat that score.
- After the final round, the player with the highest score wins.

STRATEGY TIPS
-------------
- Keeping fewer dice gives more chances to roll big combinations.
- Breaking up triples is allowed but lowers immediate points.
- Hot dice allow you to re-roll all six dice, often leading to high scores.
- Stopping early can protect points, but pushing your luck may pay off.
